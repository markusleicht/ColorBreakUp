% BACKGROUND:
% The function CBU_MODEL was written during the author's doctorate. The associated doctoral thesis refers to the model and provides further information on the subject of color break-up (CBU): Leicht, M. (2022). Perception of Color Break-Up [Doctoral thesis]. Ilmenau University of Technology).
%
% PURPOSE:
% The CBU_MODEL aspires to forecast a viewer's perception of CBU on an objectified basis for predefined scenarios. The model scenario always includes (1) a field-sequential color (FSC) display system presenting digital content and (2) a viewer observing this content. Under certain conditions, such a scenario potentially leads to the occurrence of CBU effects (see Chapter 2 in the associated doctoral thesis). The CBU effects are computed by the CBU_MODEL in a multi-stage process. 
%
% BENEFIT:
% Modeling of potentially CBU-provoking scenarios is advantageous in many ways. First, it is beneficial to assess CBU effects quantitatively and objectively, in contrast to expensive empirical research with its technical and participant-related limitations. Second, both the processes involved in CBU genesis and the impact of certain determinants on CBU characteristics can be determined simply and straighforwardly at the push of a button. And third, the model can be used to establish a classification scheme for CBU variants with different color patterns.

% INPUT (SEGMENT II - DATA ENTRY MASK):
% Model input parameters must be determined to specify the frame conditions of the model scenario (Segment II: Data Entry Mask; current model input refers to the example of choice that is discussed in Chapter 3 of the associated doctoral thesis). The display unit's technical specifications, the characteristics of the presented content, the viewer and his/her behavior (e.g. eye movements), and other surrounding conditions need to be defined in detail. Based on the model input, light intensity and color characteristics (hue and saturation) of the displayed content (physical stimulus) that potentially provokes CBU are quantified. Furthermore, the content's size, its position at display level, and the exposure time of light emission are defined. Taking the underlying FSC principle of content creation into account, the content characterization is executed at subframe level, i.e., every single subframe is separately specified at first. This allows deconstruction of the CBU genesis to its starting point. Subsequently, the interactions of the individual subframes within a full frame cycle are computed to create a realistic copy of the displayed content. 
%
% DATA OUTPUT (SEGMENT XII - OVERVIEW TABLE):
% The corresponding stimulation of the viewer is calculated by the CBU_MODEL under consideration of the determined content characteristics, leading to the exact description of retinal stimulation within the viewer's eye. The model predicts the retinal zone of stimulation and the intensity and color characteristic profile within this area. This eventually allows to distinguish between CBU-free and CBU-loaded retinal zones by putting out a model-based replication of the perceived scene. In other words: The model output predicts a real viewer's visual impression that is provoked by the defined scenario.
% After running the function, the model's data output is summarized within an overview table (Segment XII) in the command window. The table lists the classification of experimental category and cbu phase and specifies the thresholds for cbu phase transitions (phase 1 to phase 2 to phase 3). Furthermore, the model indices that compress the complexity of the model calculations to single numbers are listed (cbu score, non-cbu score, reference score). The model input parameters are listed as well - giving an overview of the model's input and ouput.

% DESCRIPTION:
% A basic code description is embedded in the MATLAB function itself. However, the fundamental structure of the model and its build-up are described in the corresponding doctoral thesis (see Chapter 3).
%
% COMPATIBILITY:
% The function was written with MATLAB Version R2018b (OS: Windows 10, 64bit).      
%
% MATLAB SEARCH PATH
% For the functionality of the CBU_MODEL it is not necessary to add further folders to the search path. External code from Xavier Beudaert for the calculation of intersection sets (line 809-873) and from David Goodmanson for the calculation of union sets (line 994-1015) is directly implemented into the code of the CBU_MODEL.

%% SEGMENT I - GENERAL MODEL ASSUMPTIONS
%
% COORDINATE SYSTEMS
% - the coordinate system of the display unit has its point of origin in the horizontal/vertical center of the display unit, mathematically positive position values are assigned in rightward respectively upward direction and mathematically negative position values are assigned in leftward respectively downward direction
% - the point of origin of the observers's retinal coordinate system coincides with the fovea centralis, the image inversion on the retina leads to mathematically positive position values in leftward/downward direction and mathematically negative position values in rightward/upward direction
%
% OBSERVER & DISPLAY POSITION 
% - the observer's visual system is represented by a cyclops eye whose fovea centralis coincides with the horizontal/vertical center of the display unit in primary eye position 
% - the display unit is adjusted without any tilt refering the observer's head position
%
% EYE & CONTENT POSITION
% - eye respectively content positions can be determined in horizontal and vertical direction within the limits of the display unit
% - for the horizontal dimension eye and content position have to be defined by determination of two positions - the start and stop point of the eye respectivelly content movement
% - for the vertical dimension eye and content position has to be defined by determination of only one stable position of eye and content since there is no movement in vertical direction
%
% EYE & CONTENT MOVEMENT
% - only left to right movement in horizontal direction for eye and content movement (no right to left movement, no vertical movement, no transversal movement)
% - constant movement velocities for content and eye movement (no positive or negative accelaration)
% - eye and content movement do always start at the same time - no delay (important to determine the number of frame cycles that have to be calculated)
% - content disappears the moment the stop point of the movement path is reached (important to determine the number of frame cycles that have to be calculated)
% - eye movement velocity in [DEG/SEC] is defined as rotation around the eyes center of rotation (Z')
%
% EYE ANATOMY 
% - parameter of the standard observer eye refer to gullstrand-emsley schematic human eye model (Emsley, 1936)
% - retina of the standard observer is assumed to have a simplified spherical shape of r = 12.0mm (Smith & Atchison, 1997, S.678)
% - optical axis, visual axis and fixation line are assumed to be identical, meaning that angle epsilon (btw. optical axis and visual axis) and also angle eta (btw. optical axis and fixation line) are assumed to be zero
%
% OPTICAL IMAGING
% - transition from content position on display / screen in [DEG] to retinal position in [DEG] via nodal points N and N'
% - calculation of retinal image size in [MM] via display-to-retina transition correction
%
% COLOR AND LIGHT INTENSITY
% - light color of all single SF is generally described via chromaticity coordinates (x,y) 
% - light intensity of all single SF is generally described in a physical manner in radiance (Le) in [W/(SR.*M2)] and as well in a photometric manner in luminance (Lv) in [CD/M2], the choice of radiance / luminance is based on the assumption of a projection setup (projector and screen)  
% - light color and intensity of the emerging mixed color (e.g. white) resulting from blending the single SFs (e.g. red, green and blue) is calculated by transitioning the chromaticity coordinates (x,y) and luminance (Lv or Y) of the single SF via tristimulus values (XYZ) to the chromaticity coordinates (x,y) and lumiance (Lv or Y) of the mixed color
%
% COGNITIVE PROCESSING
% - the time threshold for temporal summation of visual stimuli described by Bloch's Law is not determined at a fix value - e.g. 0.05sec for cones and 0.10sec for rods (Hood and Finkelstein, as cited in Blake and Sekuler, 2006, p.98) - instead, temporal summation is executed for all subframes of one full frame cycle only (frame cycle with the largest CBU effect is chosen) in order to calculate the color characteristic and light intensity profile of the resulting retinal stimulation  
% - the areal threshold for spatial summation of visual stimuli described by Ricco's Law is not considered within the model since the characteristic of the applied stimuli (position and size) within the model exceeds the limits for which Ricco's Law is valid 
%
% DEPTH OF MODEL 
% - model calculations of the resulting light intensity and color pattern of retinal stimulation mainly consider geometrical optics for position calculation in combination with the process of temporal summation of light stimuli (one full frame cycle is integrated, for the final model output the number of frame cycles presented for the defined conditions is also taken into account)
% - additional processing steps - e.g. variability of retinal sensitivity from fovea to periphery or cognitive processing regarding saccadic suppression - which lead to the actual subjective perception of cbu are not considered so far

% SUBFRAME_LOCATION_TABLE_HOR_MM >> transition of retinal position specification from angle value in [DEG] (see subframe_location_table_hor_x1 in the section above) to distance value in [MM] (see subframe_location_table_hor_mm below)
% the calculations for retinal positions of the displayed content above are made under the assumption that the optical path goes through the first (N) and second nodal point (N´) of the viewers eye which has the benefit that the angle of the incident light ray is similar to the angle of the outgoing light ray - no further calculation is necessary (see subframe_location_table_hor_x1), this works perfectly well as long as relevant retinal positions can be expressed in [DEG]
% however, if the retinal position has to be stated in [MM] a conversion from the angle in [DEG] to the distance in [MM] for the retinal position is not trivial, the problem is that the retinal position in [DEG] (see subframe_location_table_hor_x1) can not be transfered into retinal position in [MM] via simple calculation of the circular arc by using the the parameter (1) retinal radius (see RR_m) and (2) angle x1 (see subframe_location_table_hor_x1) starting from the second nodal point (N´), the reason is that the midpoint of the circle (Z) representing the retinal shape (approximation!) is not equal to the second nodal point (N´), which is relevant for the transition of the optical path from the display unit through the optics of the eye to the retina, instead angle x1 has to be converted into angle x2 (see code for subframe_location_table_hor_x2 below) at first, afterwards the calculation of the circular arc can be operated by using the parameter (1) retinal radius (see RR_m) and (2) angle x2 (see subframe_location_table_hor_x2) starting from the midpoint of the circle representing the retinal shape, the result is the retinal position as distance to the point of origin of the coordinate system (fovea centralis) in [MM] (see subframe_location_table_hor_mm) >> there is also a graphical illustration of the geometrical relations >> see confluence >> theoretical cbu model >> display-to-retina correction (helpful for a better understanding)

% SUBFRAME_LOCATION_TABLE_VER_X1 shows vertical retinal position of subframes in [DEG]
% the calculation of the subframe positions in vertical direction is trivial (in comparison to the horizontal positions of the subframes, see above) since there is no content or eye movement in vertical direction
% therefore, there is only an upper and lower content edge which is identical for all subframes
% the two values are listed in the SUBFRAME_LOCATION_TABLE_VER_X1 (2row vector, row1 = upper content edge = mathematically higher value, row2 = lower content edge = mathematically lower value)

subframe_location_table_ver_x1(1,1) = content_position_ver_deg - eye_position_ver_deg; % stable upper vertical content edge
subframe_location_table_ver_x1(2,1) = content_position_ver_deg - content_height_deg - eye_position_ver_deg; % lower content edge

% SUBFRAME_LOCATION_TABLE_VER_MM >> transition of retinal position specification from angle value in [DEG] (see subframe_location_table_ver_x1 in the section above) to distance value in [MM] (see subframe_location_table_ver_mm below)
% the calculations for retinal positions of the displayed content above are made under the assumption that the optical path goes through the first (N) and second nodal point (N´) of the viewers eye which has the benefit that the angle of the incident light ray is similar to the angle of the outgoing light ray - no further calculation is necessary (see subframe_location_table_ver_x1), this works perfectly well as long as relevant retinal positions can be expressed in [DEG]
% however, if the retinal position has to be stated in [MM] a conversion from the angle in [DEG] to the distance in [MM] for the retinal position is not trivial, the problem is that the retinal position in [DEG] (see subframe_location_table_ver_x1) can not be transfered into retinal position in [MM] via simple calculation of the circular arc by using the the parameter (1) retinal radius (see RR_m) and (2) angle x1 (see subframe_location_table_ver_x1) starting from the second nodal point (N´), the reason is that the midpoint of the circle (Z) representing the retinal shape (approximation!) is not equal to the second nodal point (N´), which is relevant for the transition of the optical path from the display unit through the optics of the eye to the retina, instead angle x1 has to be converted into angle x2 (see code for subframe_location_table_ver_x2 below) at first, afterwards the calculation of the circular arc can be operated by using the parameter (1) retinal radius (see RR_m) and (2) angle x2 (see subframe_location_table_ver_x2) starting from the midpoint of the circle representing the retinal shape, the result is the retinal position as distance to the point of origin of the coordinate system (fovea centralis) in [MM] (see subframe_location_table_ver_mm) >> there is also a graphical illustration of the geometrical relations >> see confluence >> theoretical cbu model >> display-to-retina correction (helpful for a better understanding)

        % aim is to readout the correct SF union and intersection sets from cbu_table_union and cbu_table_intersection in order to combine them and calculate the borders for the separated SF combinations like described in the tables above (see left side), therefore at first the correct positions of the SF combinations within the cbu_table_intersect respectivelly cbu_table_union have to be determined (see number elements on the right side), the determination of the number elements is described as follows:
        % the first column number of the tables middle row element - which is in row position [(subframe_number.*2)-1] in every case - is always [((subframe_number.*subframe_number)+subframe_number)/2] for cbu phase 1, for the condition of 5SF the element would be [15] in row 5, the corresponding second column number is always a blank [x] for the middle row element 
        % for all other table elements there is a simple pattern to fill out the remaining gaps of the table: starting with the first number of the first column in descending row order down to the last element before the already known middle row element, it is the numbers of the first rows (downward movement within table) of the sections of cbu_table_intersect (see tables in previous chapter), since it is clear how many rows are part of every section in cbu_table_intersect it is pretty easy to calculate the numbers assigned to the first row in every section, for the taken example of 5SF the chronological order is [1]-[6]-[10]-[13]       
        % the corresponding elements in second column in the upper part of the table (up to the last element before the already known middle row element) are similarly easy to determine, starting again with the first number of the second column in descending row order down to the last element before the already known middle element, it is the numbers of the last rows (upward movement within table) of the sections of cbu_table_union in this case (see tables in previous chapter), since it is clear how many rows are part of every section in cbu_table_union it is pretty easy to calculate the numbers assigned to the last row in every section, for the taken example of 5SF the chronological order is [14]-[12]-[9]-[5]
        % the whole lower part of the cbu_table (all elements below the middle row) for cbu phase 1 can be fully derived from the already determined upper part of the same cbu_table, the elements of the upper part have to be mirrored on a fictitious horizontal axis going trough the tables middle row and a fictitious vertical axis between the first and the second column, means that the chronological order of the second column elements in the upper part of the cbu_table are recurrent in the first column elements of the lower part of the cbu_table ([14]-[12]-[9]-[5] for 5SF example), furthermore the element order of the first column in the upper part of the cbu_table is repeated in the second column in the lower part of the cbu_table ([1]-[6]-[10]-[13] for the 5SF example) 
        % after all table elements are determined there is one more step to do, combine the determined SF union and intersection sets (with the number elements it is possible to determine a general pattern and write a general code for various conditions) and finally determine the borders of the separated SF combinations for the present conditions (like described in the tables above on the left side), at first the determined table elements (see tables above, right side) are used to read out the correct positions within cbu_table_intersect and cbu_table_union, since every position within cbu_table_intersect / cbu_table_union has two values (start and stop point of the intersection or union of SF) the correct value of both has to be chosen 
        % therefore for the upper part of the cbu_table (above the middle row) the mathematically higher border value of the separated SF combination is determined by choosing the maximum value of both given values (see code below) within the position of cbu_table_intersect refering to the determined number element in the first column (see table above), the mathematically lower border value of the separated SF combination is determined by choosing the maximum value of both given values (see code below) within the position of cbu_table_union refering to the determined number element in the second column (see table above) 
        % the middle row element of the cbu_table is determined by simply choosing both values within the position of the cbu_table_intersect representing the intersection of all available SF for this condition, the position of the correct values is always at the end of the cbu_table_intersect
        % for the lower part of the cbu_table (below the middle row) the mathematically higher border value of the separated SF combination is determined by choosing the minimum value of both given values (see code below) within the position of cbu_table_union refering to the determined number element in the second column (see table above), the mathematically lower border value of the separated SF combination is determined by choosing the minimum value of both given values (see code below) within the position of cbu_table_intersect refering to the determined number element in the first column (see table above)

    % in addition, different numbers of subframes lead to a different structure of the cbu_table

        % cbu_assi_one contains all possible SF combinations like cbu_table_union and cbu_table_intersect does
        % however, the difference between cbu_assi_one and the previous tables is that within cbu_assi_one the borders for the SF combinations are calculated under the assumption of exclusion of other SF shares (e.g. row 2 in the first example below (4SF) means that only SF2 is available in this area and no other SF like SF1 or SF3 to SF4 are available) 
        % every row within cbu_assi_one consists of three parts (left side), the middle part is always the separated SF combination that has to be calculated, the two parts to the left and to the right are all other SFs that have to be excluded when explicit occurance of the middle part has to be assured 
        % the numbers (right side) behind the description of the three parts to combine (left side) are the positions (rows) of the explicit subframe combinations within cbu_table_intersect and cbu_table_union (see tables above)

        % the third column numbers ([14]-[12]-[9]-[5]-[x]) of section 1 stand for the SF combinations that have to be excluded (SF combinations with higher numbers), this series of numbers always starts with [(((subframe_number.*subframe_number)+subframe_number)/2)-1], this is always the case without exception, in this case the result is a [14] which the pattern also starts with, to calculate the number of the second row the last number added on the left side (see description above) has to be decreased again by 1 (which is 2, since the last number added on the left side was +3) and than subtracted from [14], consequently the number of the second row is [12], the following rows are calculated by subtracting numbers that continuously decrease by 1 until the end of the section is reached, it has to be considered that the last number of every section on the right side is always a blank [x]

        %
        % the general pattern to calculate the second column numbers (as the basis for the transfer of first and third column number into the table) is explained as follows:
        % at first sight there is no apparent general pattern that fits the different conditions (illustrated exemplarily for 4SF and 5SF in the five tables above), however, with some further thinking it becomes clear that the first numbers of the second column are the first rows of the sections of cbu_table_intersect, since it is clear how many rows are part of every section of cbu_table_intersect it is pretty easy to calculate the numbers assigned to the first row in every section, it depends on the sub-category how many number can be determined like this, for the first sub-category it is [subframe - 1 ] numbers that can be determined like this, e.g. the first four numbers of the second column within cbu_table can be determined for the 5SF condition and the requirement of [A(SF4) > E(SF1) > A(SF5)] for the first sub-category (see table above), for this example the numbers are [1]-[6]-[10]-[13], every following sub-category allows one number less to be calculated like explained, means that the second sub-category of the 5SF condition allows to determine the first three numbers like this ... and so on       
        % luckily almost exactly the same procedure can be done when determining the last numbers of the cbu_tables second column, the only difference is that the numbers are transfered from the cbu_table_intersection by taking not the numbers of the first but the last rows of every section of cbu_table_intersect, again these numbers can be calculated without any further effort since it is well known how many rows each section of cbu_table_intersect has (and also established that the numbers of this column are in chronological order in upwards direction starting at [1]), for the previous example of the 5SF condition and the first sub-category the numbers would be [5]-[9]-[12]-[14] starting from the last position upwards within the table, since the cbu_table for this condition has nine rows in total there is only one row left in the middle of the table which has no number assigned (for other conditions the gap of not assigned numbers it larger since the amount of numbers that can be determined with the explaind procedure decreases with further sub-categories (like already explained), to get a better overview the numbers that can be determined with the explained procedure are separated from the remaining previously unknown numbers in the middle visually by a dashed line in the cbu_table (see above)   
        % the remaining numbers in the middle of the table can be calculated with another procedure based on another pattern, the number of the first middle row element directly below the dashed line can be determined by going two rows up, taking the already established number and increasing it by the value of 1, for the previous example of 5SF condition / first sub-category the previously unkown number in row 5 would be [11] since the number assigned two rows above in row 3 is [10], now this cbu_table is completed, all numbers in second column are determined, as already mentioned some cbu_tables refering to other conditions than in the example taken up do have larger gaps, in this case the same procedure is repeated until every row within the gap is filled with a number, means that the second position in the gap is assigned with a number by again going up two rows, taking the assigned number in this row and increasing the number again by the value of 1, in case of more than two gap positions the procedure is repeated until all posiions in the gap are filled with a number, the described two procedures are sufficient to fill all second columns of all cbu_tables for all available conditions (subframe number, cbu phase and their sub-categories ...) 
        % after all numbers in second column are assigned the first and third column of the cbu_table can be determined without further effort since the every second column number has a fix neighbour that can be determined via cbu_table_intersect / cbu_table_union, the corresponding first and third column numbers to the number in second column are simply looked up in cbu_table_intersect / cbu_table_union and transfered to cbu_table.

    % the calculations for retinal positions of the displayed content above are made under the assumption that the optical path goes through the first (N) and second nodal point (N´) of the viewers eye which has the benefit that the angle of the incident light ray is similar to the angle of the outgoing light ray - no further calculation is necessary (see cbu_table_x1), this works perfectly well as long as relevant retinal positions can to be expressed in [DEG]
    % however, if the retinal position has to be stated in [MM] a conversion from the angle in [DEG] to the distance in [MM] for the retinal position is not trivial, the problem is that the retinal position in [DEG] (see cbu_table_x1) can not be transfered into retinal position in [MM] via simple calculation of the circular arc by using the the parameter (1) retinal radius (see RR_m) and (2) angle x1 (see cbu_table_x1) starting from the second nodal point (N´), the reason is that the midpoint of the circle (Z) representing the retinal shape (approximation!) is not equal to the second nodal point (N´), which is relevant for the transition of the optical path from the display unit through the optics of the eye to the retina, instead angle x1 has to be converted into angle x2 (see code for cbu_table_x2 below) at first, afterwards the calculation of the circular arc can be operated by using the parameter (1) retinal radius (see RR_m) and (2) angle x2 (see cbu_table_x2) starting from the midpoint of the circle representing the retinal shape, the result is the retinal position as distance to the point of origin of the coordinate system (fovea centralis) in [MM] (see cbu_table_mm) >> there is also a graphical illustration of the geometrical relations >> see confluence >> theoretical cbu model >> display-to-retina correction (helpful for a better understanding)
